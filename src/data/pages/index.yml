    Unison is an open source functional programming language based on a simple idea with big implications: code is content-addressed and immutable.

intro: |
  Unison's core idea is that code is immutable and identified by its content. This lets us reimagine many aspects of how a programming language works. We simplify codebase management â€” Unison has no builds, no dependency conflicts, and renaming things is trivial. The same core idea forms the basis for a runtime that robustly supports dynamic code deployment, allowing a single Unison program to describe entire elastic distributed systems.

  Though a lot of the work on Unison is still experimental and ongoing, we're sharing an early alpha release of the language for you to test out. We'll make a more finished release generally available soon. In the meantime, anyone is welcome to [help with alpha testing](/docs).
